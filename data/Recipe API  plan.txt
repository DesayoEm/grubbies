Perfect choice! Let's break this down into a daily challenge plan for building a Recipe Management API. I'll outline the requirements and learning objectives for each day.

Requirements Overview:
```
Technical Requirements:
- FastAPI
- Python 3.7+
- File handling for images
- In-memory dictionary storage (for now)
- Pydantic models for data validation

Core Features:
- Recipe CRUD operations
- Image upload/retrieval
- Recipe categorization
- Search/filter functionality
- Basic user management
```

Daily Challenge Plan:

Day 1: Core Recipe Management
- Recipe model with basic fields (name, ingredients, steps, cooking time, servings)
- CRUD endpoints for recipes
- Basic validation with Pydantic
Learning focus: Request/Response models, Status codes, Error handling

Day 2: File Handling & Images
- Image upload endpoint
- Image retrieval endpoint
- Handling multiple file formats
- File size validation
Learning focus: File operations, Form data, Response streaming

Day 3: Recipe Categories & Search
- Add categories to recipes
- Search by ingredients
- Filter by cooking time, difficulty
- Sort results
Learning focus: Query parameters, Response models, Filtering logic

Day 4: User System & Dependencies
- Basic user model
- Authentication system
- User-recipe relationships
- Recipe ownership
Learning focus: Dependencies, Security, Authentication

Day 5: Middleware & Advanced Features
- Request logging
- Rate limiting
- Response compression
- Background tasks (like image optimization)
Learning focus: Middleware, Background tasks, Performance
